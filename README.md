üë©‚Äçüíª About Website
This is a website to show graphs that reflect the misclassifications and ambiguity of the SER technology.

Whether it is classifying emotive as neutral or vice versa, misclassifications(classifying an audio as "angry" versus "happy"), we hope to provide a simplistic website for users to see the flaws more visually.

üåê About SER
SER has been around a long time, however rarely has it's shortcomings as a scientific tool been pointed out, most of its paper as well lacks credibility because of irreproducibility issues. Inherently emotions are difficult to categorize, whether that be linguistic, cultural, or demographic background, thus calling into question the scientific background of SER. As well as the concept of categorizing emotions into said buckets when often emotions comes in mixtures, and the grey areas between. Not only are the differences for the speakers of the audios not accounted but also the biases and limited perceptions of the labelor. We hope through the paper and website to reveal these inconsistencies and call upon the SER field to re-examine its approaches and perceptions around it.
